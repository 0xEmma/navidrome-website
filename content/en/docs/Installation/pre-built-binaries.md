  Ready to use binaries for all major platforms
---

Just head to the [releases page](https://github.com/deluan/navidrome/releases) and download the latest version for you 
platform. There are builds available for Linux (amd64 and arm), macOS and Windows (32 and 64 bits). 
For Raspberry Pi (tested with Raspbian Buster on Pi 4), use the Linux arm builds.

Remember to install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) in your system, a requirement for Navidrome to work 
properly. You may find the latest static build for your platform here: https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/ 

If you have any issues with these binaries, or need a binary for a different platform, please 
[open an issue](https://github.com/deluan/navidrome/issues)
