This is just a summary on how to get started. More information will soon be available.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

### Getting started

1. Install [GoLang 1.14](https://golang.org/dl/)
2. Install [Node 14](http://nodejs.org/)
3. Install development tools: `make setup-dev`
4. Test installation: `make buildall`

To start Navidrome in development mode, just run `make dev`. This will start both the backend
and the frontend in "watch" mode, so any changes will automatically be reloaded
